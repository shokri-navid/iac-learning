# Description
Hi there,these days I am trying to apply to new vacancies in linked in and It seems that my lack of familiarity with Cloud and IAC Is one Of my big problems. with regarding that cloud providers are not available in Iran ðŸ‡®ðŸ‡·
it seems I never find a Job BUT leaving ther made us stubborn so I want to transform "this big sarrow to a big work" (this is not my sentence I borrowed it from [Touran Mirhadi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Touran_Mirhadi)ðŸŒ¹)

I want to start a self learning course (base on my own R&D not any specific online course) to getting familar with IAC technologies. So, this Is my plan:
- I will try to share my experiances and researh result like story. (I guess it could be fun, lets try!!!) ðŸ’¤
- I am a Back-end developer  mainly focused on (C#, PHP) but In this course I proissed to myself to donot use these two language my new condidates are amoung this
 list (GO lang , Python , NodeJs or maybe Rust) this helps me to learn some new programming languages and push me more out of my confort zone ðŸ˜œ
- Because I am leaving in Iran and as Iranian modern human we are facxed with a long list of sanctions and restrictions So there is no real cloud service provider available ðŸ’¥
- According to previous item I should learn How can I compose a cloud system on my local machine. maybe using K8s. But I do not know exactly I will share the result in future ðŸ˜„
- After finding that th running cloud on local machine is possible or not I will start my development phase: ðŸŽ‰
    - I will create multiple services using mentioned programming language those are listed above.
    - Then We should make them ready to auto deploy on cloud system. I have no idea yet may I should dockerize them or use other tools.
    - Then I will try to build that f**king mythical cloud engine on my laptop. 
    - and try to deploy my services on this cloud station

## First Step:
